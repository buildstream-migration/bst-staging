"""Dpkg build element

A :mod:`BuildElement <buildstream.buildelement>` implementation for using
dpkg elements

Default Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dpkg default configuration:
  .. literalinclude:: ../../../buildstream/plugins/elements/dpkg_build.yaml
     :language: yaml

Public data
~~~~~~~~~~~

This plugin writes to an element's public data.

split-rules
-----------

This plugin overwrites the element's split-rules with a list of its own
creation, creating a split domain for every package that it detected.
e.g.

.. code:: yaml

   public:
     split-rules:
       foo:
       - /sbin/foo
       - /usr/bin/bar
       bar:
       - /etc/quux

dpkg-data
---------

control
'''''''

The control file will be written as raw text into the control field.
e.g.

.. code:: yaml

   public:
     dpkg-data:
       foo:
         control: |
           Source: foo
           Section: blah
           Build-depends: bar (>= 1337), baz
           ...

name
''''

The name of the plugin will be written to the name field.
e.g.

.. code:: yaml

   public:
     dpkg-data:
       foo:
         name: foobar

package-scripts
---------------

preinstall, postinstall, prerm and postrm scripts may be written to the
package if they are detected. They are written as raw text. e.g.

.. code:: yaml

   public:
     package-scripts:
       foo:
         preinstall: |
           #!/usr/bin/bash
           /sbin/ldconfig
       bar:
         postinstall: |
           #!/usr/bin/bash
           /usr/share/fonts/generate_fonts.sh
